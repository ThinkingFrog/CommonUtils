# CPP_MISCELLANEOUS

Repo contains small projects written in **c++17**

All projects support **CMake** and contain **CMakeLists**. Some may occasionally support other build systems like **Visual Studio** or others

Repo is constantly changing and new features, comments, build details and projects probably will appear in the future

Each project contains *(or at least should)* its own **.md** file that describes main features and ideas

Common project consists of **CMakeLists.txt** file, **src** and *(optionally)* **include** folders
